# Hyperledger Fabric

The Hyperledger Fabric is an implementation of blockchain technology,
leveraging familiar and proven technologies. It offers a modular
[architecture](architecture.md) allowing pluggable implementations of
various capabilities, such as smart contracts (chaincode), cryptography,
consensus, ledger datastore and more. It leverages powerful container technology
for its deployment and for providing the execution environment for the smart
contracts (chaincode) such that the network is protected from malicious code.
